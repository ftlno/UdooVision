UdooVision
==========
Software for Udoo face detection stalker robot.
Java OpenCV program uses face detection to calculate and send commands(STOP,LEFT,RIGHT,FORWARD) from Udoobuntu to Arduino. Arduino code receives commands and uses motor 1 and motor 3 to drive towards the detected face.


Note:
----------
Buggy, but fully working. It is easy to enable gui in Java for easy debugging.
